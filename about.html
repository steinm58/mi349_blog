    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Mackenzi and I am a senior at Michigan State University studying computer science. I have created this blog for one of my many projects I have done throughout my college career. When I am not busy with school I love to read and spend time with my family and friends.</p>

    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is reading. I have always enjoyed reading ever since I was a kid, and fun fact, I actually taught myself how to read when I was younger. Right now I have a little over 100 books in various genres and authors. Some of my favorite authors and books are listed below. This blog is just a space where I can post my book reviews and some of my favorite things about reading.</p>
