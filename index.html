              <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27883214-caraval" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Caraval</a> is the first book in a three book series that is written by Stephanie Garber. It follows two sisters named Scarlett and Donatella, who get entranced by a magical performance that happens once a year called Caraval. The audience of the performance are also the performers. When the sisters finally get their chance to leave home and attend this performance, Donatella gets taken by Legend, Caraval’s mastermind, and is turned into part of the performance. It then turns into a game of who can find Donatella first. Scarlett is determined to find her sister but as she struggles to figure out what's real and what's magic, time is dwindling down.</p>
              <p>Caraval is filled with magic and romance that kept me wanting to read more and more. I loved the carnival aspect and the magic that happens in these books. There were a bunch of twists and turns that were always unexpected. In these books, you don’t know who Legend actually is, he is always in disguise, so with that there was also this mysterious aspect as well as everything else that is going on. The magic in this book is also very mysterious and it really made this book more enjoyable. You get to learn about the world as Scarlett does so it is very easy to follow and is an incredible series.</p>

              <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13597723-the-naturals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Naturals</a> is the first book in a four book series, that also includes a novella, written by Jennifer Lynn Barnes. The main character of this book is a seventeen year old girl named Cassies. She has always been good at reading people and being able to deduce things about someone that the majority of other people can't. When the FBI comes in contact with her she has to decide if she wants to join their team of teenagers that use their gifts to solve cold cases. When she becomes a member of the group of teens, she becomes a profiler for the FBI, but soon she's found to be closely involved in a case that involves a serial killer that wants her. </p>
              <p>This series is one of my favorites. It involves a lot of mystery and a little bit of romance. There are so many plot twists in every single book in the series I was always in shock while reading. Cassie basically gets sucked into this world of crime that she unfortunately isn't that unfamiliar with, but she gets a lot of support from the people around her. I loved this book and series so much because of the characters. All of the other Naturals all have their own unique ability that gives off Criminal Mind vibes and it was very intriguing to read. This book was a little slow because it was a lot about the program she joined and the world, but it is still so good and the series just kept getting better. </p>
